## UML - Class Diagram
 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date-18_July-blue)

 UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used to create diagrams that represent the design, structure, and behavior of a system. 
 It helps in understanding and designing complex systems by providing various diagram types, each serving a different purpose.

### Class Diagram:
- **Purpose:** Represents the static structure of a system, showing the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between classes.
- **Components:**
  - **Classes:** Represented as rectangles with three compartments (name, attributes, methods).
  - **Relationships:** Include associations, inheritances, aggregations, and compositions.
 
### Example - Single Class
```
+-------------------+
|   Student         |
+-------------------+
| - rollnumber: int |
| - name: string    |
+-------------------+
| + display(): void |
+-------------------+
```

### Example - Relationship between Classes
```
+--------------+              +-----------------+
|   Student    | 1          * |   Course        |
+--------------+ --------------+----------------+
| - rollnumber |              | - courseName    |
| - name       |              | - courseCode    |
+--------------+              +-----------------+
| + display()  |              | + showDetails() |
+--------------+              +-----------------+
```
