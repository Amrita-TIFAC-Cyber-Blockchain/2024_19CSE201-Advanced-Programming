## Introduction to Inheritance
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date-12_August-blue)

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the derived class or child class) to 
inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., data members and member functions) from an existing class (called the base class or parent class). 
Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, where the derived class can extend or modify the functionality 
of the base class.

##### Example
```
class Person { // Base class
public:
    string name;
    int age;
    
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

class Student : public Person { // Derived class
public:
    int rollnumber;
    
    void displayStudent() {
        display(); // Calls the base class method
        cout << "Roll Number: " << rollnumber << endl;
    }
};
```

### Types of Inheritance
There are 5 types of Inheritance supported by C++.

#### Single Inheritance
Single inheritance, a derived class inherits from only one base class.

```
class Base {
public:
    int a;
};

class Derived : public Base { // Single inheritance
public:
    int b;
};
```

#### Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance, a derived class inherits from more than one base class.

```
class Base1 {
public:
    int a;
};

class Base2 {
public:
    int b;
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 { // Multiple inheritance
public:
    int c;
};
```

#### Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a base class, and then another class is derived from that derived class.

```
class Base {
public:
    int a;
};

class Intermediate : public Base { // Intermediate class
public:
    int b;
};

class Derived : public Intermediate { // Multilevel inheritance
public:
    int c;
};
```


#### Hierarchial Inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

```
class Base {
public:
    int a;
};

class Derived1 : public Base { // First derived class
public:
    int b;
};

class Derived2 : public Base { // Second derived class
public:
    int c;
};
```

#### Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can involve any combination of single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

```
class Base {
public:
    int a;
};

class Intermediate1 : public Base { // Intermediate class 1
public:
    int b;
};

class Intermediate2 : public Base { // Intermediate class 2
public:
    int c;
};

class Derived : public Intermediate1, public Intermediate2 { // Hybrid inheritance
public:
    int d;
};
```
