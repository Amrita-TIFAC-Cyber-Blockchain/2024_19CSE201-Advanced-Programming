## Introduction to Class and Object
 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date-17_July-blue)
 
Class defines a new datatype by encapsulating data (variables) and functions that operate on the data, making the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. 
In other words, a Class is a blueprint for creating (real-world) objects. 

##### Structure of a Class
```
class <<ClassName>> {
<<access-specifier>>:
    // Public members can be accessed from outside the class
    <<data-type>> attribute1; 
	...
	...
	...
	<<data-type>> attributen; 

    // Member function declaration
    void method() {
        // Function body
    }
};

```
##### Example of a Class
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    int rollnumber;
    string name;
    
    void display() {
		cout << "Roll Number: " << rollnumber << endl;
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};
```

The above code defines a class ```Student``` which encapsulates variables ```rollnumber``` and ```name```, and a function ```display``` which prints them. Now, to access these from ```main``` function, we need to create objects. 

```
int main() {
  
   Student s1, s2; 
   return 0;

}
```

```s1```, ```s2``` are the objects of ```Student``` class. ```s1```, ```s2``` are instance which hold different values in ```rollnumber``` and ```name```. 

### Memory for s1
```
------------------------
|  s1.rollnumber  |  4 bytes  |
|  s1.name        |  pointer to dynamic memory  |
------------------------
```

```
Address  |   Data
------------------------
0x1000   |  s1.rollnumber (4 bytes)
0x1004   |  s1.name pointer (size varies)
```

### Memory for s2
```
------------------------
|  s2.rollnumber  |  4 bytes  |
|  s2.name        |  pointer to dynamic memory  |
------------------------
```

```
Address  |   Data
------------------------
0x1010   |  s2.rollnumber (4 bytes)
0x1014   |  s2.name pointer (size varies)
```

### Dot Operator
The **dot operator (.)** in C++ is used to access the members (variables and functions) of an object of a class. When you have an object of a class, you can use the dot operator to refer to the members of that object.

###### Syntax
```
objectName.memberName;
```
###### Example
```
s1.display()
s2.rollnumber
```

### Difference between struct and class

In C++, the key difference between struct and class lies in their default access specifiers for members:

_struct_: By default, all members (both data members and member functions) are public. This means that unless explicitly specified otherwise, the members of a struct can be accessed from outside the structure.

```
struct ExStruct {
    int data;        // public by default
    void function(); // public by default
};
```

_class_: By default, all members are private. This implies that without explicit access specifiers, the members cannot be accessed from outside the class.
```
class ExClass {
    int data;        // private by default
    void function(); // private by default
};
```
#### Usecases - struct and class

| **struct**                  | **class**                                  |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Plain Data Structures        | Encapsulation and Data Hiding              |
| Public Data Members by Default | Access Control (Public, Private, Protected Members) |
| Lightweight Objects (Data Holders) | Complex Data Types with Behaviors      |
| Suitable for Interfacing with C | Supports Inheritance and Polymorphism   |
| Simple Aggregation of Data   | Data Protection and Validation through Methods |
| No or Minimal Member Functions | Member Functions for Data Management   |
| Ideal for POD (Plain Old Data) | Abstraction with Clean Interfaces        |
| Direct Access to Members     | Memory Management (Constructor/Destructor) |
| Typically No Need for Inheritance | Operator Overloading for Custom Types    |
